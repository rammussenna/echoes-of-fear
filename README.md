# 🕳 The Cycle Never Ends

##  Overview

**The Cycle Never Ends** is a first-person psychological horror game focused on trauma, isolation, and the horrifying comfort of routine. Players wake up each day in a familiar setting that slowly begins to break, distort, and unravel with each repetition. As days pass, the illusion of life fades and a terrifying realization sets in: you're not just stuck in a loop — you're being punished by it.

This game is part of a larger narrative universe connected with eight other horror titles, but it stands strong as a deeply personal story of grief, memory, and consequence.

##  Features

- **Loop-Based Narrative Design**  
  Each cycle reveals new details, changes environments, or alters interactions, simulating the descent into madness and memory distortion.

- **Emotionally Driven Horror**  
  No cheap jump scares. Just existential dread, surreal events, and the sickening feeling of remembering something you'd rather forget.

- **Dynamic Memory System**  
  Your choices, actions, and emotional responses carry over — subtly changing the world and dialogues.

- **Psychological Puzzle Mechanics**  
  Solve problems born from guilt, regret, and denial. You're not just piecing together facts — you're confronting truths.

- **Multiple Endings**  
  Reach different fates based on how you respond to the loop: acceptance, resistance, escape, or surrender.

10–15 hours total

##  Main Character

**You**  
Name unknown. Backstory vague. But you’re someone who lived through something horrible — and now you're living _in_ it. The protagonist is silent, but their thoughts, memories, and regrets are scattered throughout the world.

##  Gameplay Structure

- **Morning** – A repeatable "safe" section.
- **Midday** – Interactions that seem normal at first, but subtly change.
- **Evening** – Reality breaks apart; nightmares bleed into the world.
- **Night** – A moment of confrontation, memory playback, or psychological collapse. Then… reset.

Over time, the structure collapses — routines disappear, scenes fragment, and loops corrupt.

##  Audio Direction

- **Soundtrack** – Ambient horror, reversed samples, vinyl hiss, occasional silence.
- **Voice Acting** – Minimalist. Mostly echoes, distorted past conversations, inner voices.
- **SFX** – Glitches, slow fades, distorted memories; sound is used to disorient and disturb.
